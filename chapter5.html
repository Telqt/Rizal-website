                    <h2>Bitter-Sweet Life in Dapitan</h2>
                </div>
                <p>The deportee could have stayed in the Dapitan parish convent had he retracted his anti-Catholic pronouncements and made a general confession of his past life. Not willing to accede to these main conditions set by the Jesuits, Jose Rizal instead opted to live at the commandant's residence called "Casa Real".</p>
                <p>In September 1892. Rizal and Carnicero won in a lottery. The Manila Lottery ticket no. 9736 jointly owned by Rizal, Carnicero, and a Spanish resident of Dipolog won the second prize of Php 20, 0000. Rizal used some part of his share (Php 6, 200) in procuring a parcel of land near the coast of Talisay, a barrio near Dapitan. On a property of more than 10 hectares, he put up three houses made of bamboo. wood, and nipa. He lived in the house, which was square in shape Another house. which was hexagonal, was the barn where Rizal kept his chickens. In his octagonal house lived some of his pupils for Rizal also established a school, teaching young boys practical subjects, like reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, and Spanish and English languages. Later, he constructed additional huts to accommodate his recovering out-of-town patients.</p>

                <div class="title">
                    <h2>Daily Life as an Exile</h2>
                </div>
                <p>During his exile. Rizal practiced medicine, taught some pupils, and engaged in farming and horticulture. He grew many fruit trees (like coconut, mango, lanzones. makopa, santol, mangosteen, jackfruit, guayabanos, baluno, and nanka) and domesticated some animals (like rabbits, dogs, cats, and chickens). The school he founded in 1893 started with only three pupils and had about more than 20 students at the time his exile ended.</p>
                <p>Rizal would rise at five in the morning to see his plants, feed his animais, and prepare breakfast. Having taken his morning meal. he would treat the patients who had come to his house. Paddling his boat called baroto (he had two of them), he would then proceed to Dapitan town to attend to his other patients there the whole morning.
                Rizal would return to Talisay to take his lunch. Teaching his pupils would begin at about 2 p.m. and would end at 4 or 5 in the afternoon. With the help of his pupils Rizal would spend the rest of the afternoon in farming-planting trees, watering the plants, and pruning the fruits. Rizal then would spend the night reading and writing</p>

                    <h2>Rizal and the Jesuits</h2>
                </div>
                <p>The first attempt by the Jesuit friars to win back the deported Rizal to the Catholic fold was the offer for him to live in the Dapitan convent under some conditions. Refusing to compromise. Rizal did not stay with the parish priest Antonio Obach in the church convent.</p>
                <p>Just a month after Rizal was deported to Dapitan, the Jesuit Order assigned to Dapitan the priest Francisco de Paula Sanchez, Rizal's favorite teacher in Ateneo. Many times, they engaged in cordial religious discussions. But though Rizal appreciated his mentor's efforts, he could not be convinced to change his mind. Nevertheless, their differences in belief did not get in the way of their good friendship.</p>

                <div class="title">
                    <h2>Achievements in Dapitan</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Rizal provided significant community services in Dapitan, like improving the town's drainage and constructing better water system using empty bottles and bamboo joints. He also taught the town folks about health and sanitation to avoid the spread of diseases. With his Jesuit priest friend Sanchez, Rizal made a huge relief map of Mindanao in Dapitan plaza. Also, he bettered the forest there by providing evident trails, stairs, and some benches. He invented a wooden machine for the mass production of bricks. Using the bricks he produced. Rizal built a water dam for the community with the help of his students.</p>
                <p>As the town's doctor. Rizal equally treated all patients regardless of their economic and social status. He accepted as "fees" things like poultry and crops. and at times, even gave his services to poor folks for free. His specialization was ophthalmology, but he also offered treatments to almost all kinds of diseases, like fever, sprain, broken bones, typhoid, tuberculosis, and even leprosy (Bantug & Ventura, 1997, p. 112).</p>

                    <h2>Visited by loved ones</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Rizal was in Dapitan when he learned that his true love Leonor Rivera had died. What somewhat consoled his desolate heart was the visits of his mother and some sisters.</p>

                <div class="works">
                    <p>In 1895, Do√±a Teodora left Dapitan for Manila to be with Don Francisco who was getting weaker. Shortly after his mother left, Josephine Bracken came to Jose's life. Josephine was an orphan with Irish blood and the stepdaughter of Jose's patient from Hong Kong. Rizal and Bracken were unable to obtain a church wedding because Jose would not retract his anti- Catholic views. He nonetheless took Josephine as his common-law wife who kept him company and kept house for him. Before the year ended in 1895, the couple had a child who was born prematurely. The son who was named after Rizal's father (Francisco) died a few hours after birth.</p>

                </div>
                <p>In 1895, Blumentritt informed Rizal that the revolution-ridden Cuba, another nation colonized by Spain, was raged by a yellow-fever epidemic. Because there was a shortage of physicians to attend to war victims and disease-stricken people. Rizal in December 1895 wrote to the then Governor-General Ramon Blanco. volunteering to provide medical services in Cuba. Receiving no reply from Blanco. Rizal lost interest in his request.</p>
                <p>But on July 30. 1896. Rizal received a letter from the governor-general sanctioning his petition to serve as volunteer physician in Cuba. Rizal made Immediate preparations to leave, selling and giving as souvenirs to friends and students his various properties.</p>

                    <h2>Rizal's Last 25 hours</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Accounts on Jose Rizal's last hours vary and largely depend on the historian one is reading.
                What happened in Rizal's life from 6 a.m. of December 29, 1896 until his execution was perhaps the most controversial in his biography, for the divisive claims-like his supposed retraction and Catholic marriage with Bracken-allegedly occurred within this time frame.</p>

                <div class="title">
                    <h2>From 6 am to 12 Noon</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Standard biography states that at 6 a.m. of December 29, Judge Advocate Dominguez formally read the death sentence to Rizal. At about 7 am, he was transferred to either his "death cell" or "prison chapel. He was visited by Jesuit priests, Miguel Saderra Mata and Luis Viza. They brought the medal of the Ateneo's Marian Congregation of which Rizal was a member and the wooden statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus he had carved in the school. Rizal put the wooden image on his table while he rejected the medal saying "Im little of a Marian, Father" ("Rizal's Last Hours." n.d. para. 5).</p>
                <p>At 8 am, the priest Antonio Rosell arrived, after his co-priest Viza left. Rizal shared his breakfast with Rosell. Later. Lt. Andrade came and Rizal thanked his defense lawyer. Santiago Mataix of the Spanish newspaper El Heraldo de Madrid interviewed Rizal at about 9 a.m. Then came the priest Federico Faura at about 10 am. He advised Rizal to forget about his resentment and marry Josephine canonically. The two had a heated discussion about religion as witnessed by Rosell ("Rizal's Last Hours," n.d.. para. 8)</p>
                <p>Two other priests. Jose Vilaclara and Vicente Balaguer (missionary in Dapitan). also visited Rizal at about 11 am. The Jesuits tried to convince Rizal to write a retraction. Though still believing in the Holy Scriptures. Rizal supposedly refused to retract his anti-Catholic views, exclaiming. "Look, Fathers, if I should assent to all you say and sign all you want me to, just to please you. neither believing nor feeling. I would be a hypocrite and would then be offending God" (Bantug & Ventura. 1997, p. 147)</p>

                    <p>At noon. Rizal was left alone in his cell. He had his lunch, read the Bible, and meditated About this time. Balaguer reported to the Archbishop that only a little hope remained that Rizal would retract ("Rizal's Last Hours." nd. para. 10). Refusing to receive visitors for the meantime. Rizal probably finished his last poem at this moment. Rizal also wrote to Blumentritt his last letter in which he called the Austrian scholar "my best, my dearest friend" (as cited in Cueto, 2012, pa–≥a. 7).
                    He then had a talk with priests Estanislao March and Vilaclara at about 2 p.rn. Balaguer then returned to Rizal's cell at 3:30 p.m. and allegedly discussed (again) about Rizal's retraction (G. Zaide & S. Zaide, 1984, p. 265) Rizal then wrote letters and dedications and rested shortly

                <p>At 4 pm., the sorrowful Do√±a Teodora and Jose's sisters went to see the sentenced Rizal. The mother was not allowed a last embrace by the guard, but her beloved son, in quiet grief, managed to press a kiss on her hand. Dominguez was said to have been moved with compassion at the sight of Rizal's kneeling before his mother and asking for forgiveness ("Rizal's Last Hours. n.d., para. 14). As the dear visitors were leaving. Jose handed over to Trinidad an alcohol cooking stove, a gift from the Pardo de Taveras, whispering to her in a language which the guards could not comprehend. "There is something in it." That "something" was Rizal's elegy now known as Mi Ultimo Adios (Bantug & Ventura. 1997. p. 149)</p>
                <p>The Dean of the Manila Cathedral. Don Silvino Lopez Tu√±on, went to see Rizal to exchange some views with him at about 5.30 p.m. Balaguer and March then left, leaving Vilaciara and Tu√±on in Rizal's cell. As Rosell was leaving at about 6 p.m., Josephine Bracken arrived in Fort Santiago Rizal called for her, and they emotionally talked with each other ('Rizal's Last Hours." n.d., para. 16).</p>

                <p>At 7 p.m.. Faura returned and convinced Rizal to trust him and some other Ateneo professors. After some quiet moments. Rizal purportedly confessed to Faura ("Rizal's Last Hours," n.d., para. 17).
                Rizal then took his last supper at about 8 p.m. and attended to his personal needs He then told Dominguez that he had forgiven his enemies and the military judges.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The Zaides alleged that at 3 a.rn., Rizal heard Mass, confessed sins, and took Communion (1984. p. 266) At about 4 a.m., Rizal picked up the book Imitation of Christ by Thomas a Kempis, read, and meditated. At 5 a.m. he washed up, attended to his personal needs. read the Bible, and contemplated. For breakfast, he was given three boiled eggs. Rizal's grandniece Asuncion Lopez-Rizal Bantug mentioned "three soft-boiled eggs and narrated that Rizal ate two of them (Bantug & Ventura, 1997, pp. 151-152) Historian Ambeth R. Ocampo, on the other hand, wrote "three hard- boiled eggs and related that Rizal "did not have any breakfast (Ocampo. 2012. p. 227). Both historians nevertheless wrote that Rizal placed the boiled egg (or eggs) to a cell corner saying in effect. "This is for the rats, let them celebrate likewise!"</p>

                <p>Alterward, Rizal wrote letters, one addressed to his family and another to Paciano. To his family, he partly wrote. "I ask you for forgiveness for the pain I cause you I die resigned, hoping that with my death you will be left in peace." He also left this message to his sisters: "I enjoin you to forgive one another. Treat your old parents as you would like to be treated by your children later. Love them very much in my memory" To Paciano, he partially wrote, "I am thinking now how hard you have worked to give me a career - I know that you have suffered much on my

                    occount and I am sorry" (as cited in G. Zaide & S. Zaide, 1984, pp. 266-267)</p>

                <p>Before Rizal made his death march to Bagumbayan, he managed to pen his last letters to his beloved parents. To Don Francisco, he wrote. "Pardon me for the pain which I repay you Good bye, Father, goodbye. Perhaps told by the authorities that the march was about to begin. Rizal managed to write only the following to his mother (as cited in G. Zaide & S. Zaide, 1984, p. 268):</p>

                </div>
                <p>At 6:30 am, Rizal in black suit and black bowler hat, tied elbow to elbow, began his slow walk to Bagumbayan. He walked along with his defense lawyer. Andrade. and two Jesuit priests. March and Vilaclara. In front of them were the advance guards of armed soldiers and behind them was another group of military men The sound of a trumpet signaled the start of the death march, and the muffled sound of drums served as the musical score of the walk.</p>
                <p>Early on that morning, many people had eagerly lined the streets. Some were sympathetic to him. others-especially the Spaniards-wanted nothing less than to see him die. Some observed that Rizal kept keenly looking around, and "it was believed that his family or the Katipuneros would make a last-minute effort to spring him from the trap (Ocampo, 2012, p. 228).</p>
                <p>Once in a while. Rizal conversed with the priests, commenting on things like his happy years at the Ateneo as they passed by Intramuros. Commenting on the clear morning, he was said to have uttered something like. "What a beautiful mar On days like this I used to take a walk hare with my sweetheart".</p>
