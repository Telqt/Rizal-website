                <p>José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda was born on June 19, 1861 in Calamba, Laguna. The seventh of eleven children born to a relatively well-off family in a Dominican-owned tenant land in Calamba, Laguna, Jose Rizal lived and died during the Spanish colonial era in the Philippines.</p>

                    <p>In his early childhood, Jose had mastered the alphabet and learned to write and read. His early readings included the Spanish version of the Vulgate Bible At a young age, he already showed inclinations to the arts. He amazed his family by his pencil drawings, sketches, and moldings of clay Later in his childhood, he showed special talent in painting and sculpture, wrote a Tagalog play, which was presented at a town fiesta (and later penned a short play in Spanish, which was presented in school). Jose's father. Francisco Engracio Rizal Mercado, was a productive farmer from Biñan, Laguna. He was an independent-minded, taciturn, but dynamic gentleman from whom Jose inherited his "free soul." Don Francisco became tiniente gobernadorcillo (lieutenant governor) in Calamba and was thus nicknamed Tiniente Kiko. (Some students' comical conjecture that the fictional character Kikong Matsing of Batibot was named after Don Francisco is, of course, unfounded.)</p>

                        woman from Sta. Cruz, Manila. Common biographies state that Doña Teodora Alonso Quintos Realonda also known as "Lolay, was born on November 8. 1826 in Santa Cruz. Manila and baptized at the Santa Cruz Church. Strangely however, the volume in the church books that supposedly contained Teodora's baptismal records was the only one missing from the otherwise complete records down to the eighteenth century.</p>

                <p>Narcisa Rizal (1852-1939) or simply "Sisa" was the third child in the family. Later in history. Narcisa (like Sturnina) would help in financing Rizal's studies in Europe even pawning her jewelry and peddling her clothes if needed it was said she could recite from memory almost all of the poems of our national hero (Discussions on Jose's known poems are available in Appendix): "Jose Rizal's Poems.")</p>
                <p>Olympia Rizal (1855-1887) was the fourth child in the Rizal family, Jose loved to tease her sometimes good-humoredly describing her as his stout sister. Jose's first love. Segunda Katigbak, was Dlympia's schoolmate at the La Concordia College Rizal confided to Olympia (also spelled Olimpia) about Segunda, and the sister willingly served as the mediator between the two teenage lovers. (For Jose Rizal-and- Segunda Katigbak's love story, read Appendix P "Jose Rizal's Filipino Girlfriends.")</p>
                <p>Lucia Rizal 1857-1919) was the fifth child in the family. She married Mariano Herbosa of Calamba Lagund Charged of inciting the Calamba townsfolk not to pay land rent and causing unrest, the couple was once ordered to be deported along with some Rizal family members (Lucia's husband died during the cholera epidemic in May 1889 and was refused a Catholic burial for not going to confession since his marriage to Lucia. In Jose's article in La Solidaridad titled Una profanacion (A Profanation), he scornfully attacked the friars for declining to bury in sacred ground" o "good Christion simply because he was the 'brother-in-law of Rizal)</p>
                <p>Mario Roll (1959-1945) was the sixth child in the family. It was to her whom jose talked about wanting to marry Josephine Bracken when the majority of the Rizal family was apparently not amenable to the idea. </p>
                <p>Also called "Concha by her siblings Concepcion Rizal (1862-1865) was the eighth Child of the Rizal family She died at the age of three Of his sisters, it was said that the young Pepe loved most little Concha who was a year younger than he jose played games and shared children stories with her, and from her he felt the beauty of sisterly love at a young age.</p>
                <p>Josefa Rizal's nickname is Panggoy (1865-1945) She was the ninth child in the family panggay, died a spinster Among lose's letters to josefa, the one dated October 26 1893/ was perhaps the most fascinating Written in English the letter addressed Josefa as "Miss Josephine Rizal"</p>
                <p>Trinidad Rizal (1868-1951) or 'Trining" was the tenth child. Historically, she became the custodian of Rizal's last and greatest poem Right before jose's execution. Trinidad and their mother visited him in the Fort Santiago prison cell As they were leaving, Jose handed over to Trining an alcohol cooking stove, a gift from the Pardo de Taveras, whispering to her in a language, which the guards could not understand. There is something in it That "something" was Rizal's elegy now known as Mi Ultimo Adios Like Josefa, Paciano, and two nieces. Trinidad joined the Katipunan after Jose's death.</p>
                <p>Rizal family Being a teacher, she was arguably the best educated arnong Rizal's sisters in his long and meaty letter to Choleng dated June 6. 1890 ("Jose Rizal on Facebook Courtship." 2013), Jose told her sister that he was proud of her for becoming a teacher. He thus counseled her to be a model of virtues and good qualities "for the one who should teach should be better than the persons who need her learning." Rizal nonetheless used the topic as leverage in somewhat rebuking her sister for getting married to Pantaleon Quintero of Calamba without their parents consent Because of you" he wrote, "the peace of our family has been disturbed.</p>

                    <h2>Rizal's Birth</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Daña Teodora was said to have suffered the greatest pain during the delivery of her seventh child, Jose Her daughter Narcisa recalled "I was nine years of age when my mother gave birth to Jose. I recall it vividly because my mother suffered great pain. She labored for a long time. Her pain was later attributed to the fact that jose's head was bigger than normal (as cited in "Lola Lolay." 2013, para 8).
                Jose Rizal was born in Calamba. In 1848, his parents decided to build a home in this town in Laguna, southern Luzon. The name Calamba was derived from kalan banga, which means clay stove" (kalan) and "water jar (banga).</p>
                <p>Jose's adoration of its scenic beauty-punctuated by the sights of the Laguna de Bay. Mount Makiling, palm-covered mountains, curvy hills, and green fields was recorded in the poem he would later write at Ateneo de Manila in 1876. Un Recuerdo A Mi Pueblo (in Memory of My Town). </p>

                    <h2>The Childhood of a Phenom</h2>
                </div>
                <p>A phenom is someone who is exceptionally talented or admired, especially an up-and-comer. Rizal, especially during his childhood, was none less than a phenom.
                Jose Rizal's first memory, in his infancy, was his happy days in their family garden when he was three years old. Their courtyard contained tropical fruit trees, poultry yard, a carriage house, and a stable for the ponies. Because the young Pepe was weak, sickly, and undersized. he was given the fondest care by his parents, so his father built a nipa cottage for Pepe to play in the daytime.</p>
                <p>Memory of his infancy included the nocturnal walk in the town, especially when there was a moon. Jose also recalled the "aya" (nursemaid) relating to the Rizal children some fabulous stories, like those about the fairies; tales of buried treasure, and trees blooming with diamonds.
                Another childhood memory was the daily Angelus prayer in their home. Rizal recorded in his memoir that by nightfall, his mother would gather all the children in their home to pray the Angelus. At the early age of three, he started to take a part in the family prayers.</p>

                    <h2>Education in Calamba</h2>
                </div>
                <p>The familiar statement that Doña Teodora was Rizal's first teacher is not just a sort of "venerating his mother who sacrificed a lot for our hero. It was actually a technical truth In his memoirs, Rizal wrote. My mother taught me how to read and to say haltingly the humble prayers which I raised fervently to God.</p>
                <p>In Rizal's time, seldom would one see a highly educated woman of fine culture. like Doña Teodora who had the capacity to teach Spanish, reading poetry, and values through rare story books. Lolay, indeed, was the first teacher of the hero- teaching him Spanish. correcting his composed poems, and coaching him in rhetoric. On her lap. Jose learned the alphabet and Catholic prayers at the age of three, and learned to read and write at age of 5.</p>
