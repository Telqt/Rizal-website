                <p>  The Rizal Bill was as controversial as Jose Rizal himself.
                    The mandatory Rizal subject in the Philippines was the upshot of this bill, which later became a law in 1956. The bill invalves mandating educational institutions in the country to offer a course on the hero's life, works, and writings, especially the Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. The transition from being a bill to becoming a republic act was, however, not easy as the proposal was met with intense opposition, particularly from the Catholic Church.</p>
                    
                    <div class="works">
                        <p>Largely because of the issue, the then senator Claro M. Recto the main proponent of the Rizal Bill-was even dubbed as a communist and an anti-Catholic Catholic schools threatened to stop operation if the bill was passed though Recto calmly countered the threat, stating that if that happened, the schools would be nationalized. Afterward threatened to be punished in future elections. Recto remained undeterred. Concerning the suggestion to use instead the expurgated (edited) version of Rizal's novels as mandatory readings, Recto explained his firm support for the unexpurgated version, exclaiming: "The people who would eliminate the books of Rizal from the schools would blot out from our minds the memory of the national hero.
                        The bill was eventually passed, but with a clause that would allow exemptions to students who think that reading the Noli and Fili would ruin their faith. In other words, one can apply to the Department of Education for exemption from reading Rizal's novels though not from taking the Rizal subject. The bill was enacted on June 12, 1956.</p>

Works and Writings of Jose Rizal. Particularly His Novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, Authorizing the Printing and Distribution Thereof, and for Other Purposes."</p>
                    <p>The first section of the law concerns mandating the students to read Rizal novels. The last two sections involve making Rizal's writings accessible to general public they require the schools to have a sufficient number of copies in their libraries and mandate the publication of the works in major Philipp languages. </p>
                    <p>Jose P. Laurel, then senator who co-wrote the law, explained that since Jose Ra of coper

                    <li> To rededicate the lives of youth to the ideals of freedom and nationale for which our heroes lived and died;</li>

                    <p>So far, no student has yet officially applied for exemption from reading Rizal's novels. Correspondingly, former President Fidel V. Ramos in 1994, through Memorandum Order No. 247. directed the Secretary of Education. Culture and Sports and the Chairman of the Commission on Higher Education to fully implement the RA 1425 as there had been reports that the law had still not been totally carried out. In 1995. CHED Memorandum No. 3 was issued enforcing strict compliance to Memorandum Order No. 247</p>
