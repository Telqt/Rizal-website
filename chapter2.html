                <p>Contextualization aids comprehension. Generally, to contextualize something is to place it within its proper and larger setting in which it presents its true and complete meaning. As Jose Rizal was born and grew up in the 19th century, to contextualize him-so as to properly understand his life, thoughts, and works-is to understand the social and political context of that century.</p>
                <p>Nineteenth century is commonly depicted as the birth of modern life, as well as the birth of many nation-states around the globe. The century was also a period of massive changes in Europe, Spain, and consequently in the Philippines. It was during this era that the power and glory of Spain, the Philippines' colonizer. had waned both in its colonies and in the world.
                Discussions on the 19th century Philippines as Rizal's context are hereby divided into three (3) aspects: the economic, social, and political. Under these main headings are major historical events or issues, which characterized the country during that era.</p>
                <div class="title">
                    <h2>The Economic Context</h2>
                </div>
                <p>At least four historical elements basically compose the economic context of the era in which Jose Rizal was born: (a) the end of the Galleon Trade, (b) the opening of the Suez Canal, (c) the rise of the export of the crop economy, and (d) the established monopolies in the Philippines.</p>
                <div class="title">
                    <h2>End of Galleon Trade</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="works">
                    <img src="./files/galleon.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Our locals were already trading with China, Japan, Siam (now Thailand), India Cambodia, Borneo, and the Moluccas (Spice Islands) when the Spanish colonizers came to the Philippines In 1565. the Spanish government closed the ports of Manila to all countries except Mexico, thereby giving birth to the Manila-Acapulco Trade. popularly known as the "Galleon Trade."
                    The Galleon Trade (1565 to 1815) was a ship (galleon") trade going back and forth between Manila (which actually landed first in Cebu) and Acapulco, Mexico. It started when Andres de Urdaneta, in convoy under Miguel Lopez de Legaspi. discovered a return route from Cebu to Mexico in 1565. The trade served as the central income generating business for Spanish colonists in the Philippines</p>

                    <h2>Opening of the Suez Canal</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="works">
                    <p>An artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, the Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea ugh the Isthmus of Suez. Constructed by the Suez Canal Company between 1859 and 1869 under the leadership of French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps. it was officially opened on November 17, 1869. <br>
                    With the opening of the canal, the distance of travel between Europe and the Philippines was considerably abbreviated and thus virtually brought the country closer to Spain. Before the opening of the canal, a steamer from Barcelona had to sail around the Cape of Good Hope to reach Manila after a menacing journey of more than three months. With the Suez Canal, the voyage was lessened to only 32 to 40 days</p>

                <div class="title">
                    <h2>Rise of the Export of Crop Economy</h2>
                </div>
                <p>During the Galleon Trade, most of the Spaniards in the Philippines were engrossed in maritime trading undertakings between Manila and Mexico. The exploitation of the Philippines natural resources and the progress of an export crop economy were phenomena of the nineteenth century, not of the Spanish rule's early period</p>
                <p>Some years after the end of the Galleon Trade, between 1820 and 1870, the Philippines was well on its way of developing an export crop economy. Products. such as sugar. Manila hemp. and coffee were produced for foreign markets while imported goods of the European factory industry found their way into many parts of the Philippines. The various economic activities in the new export-crop economy in the country provided many opportunities for the expanding Chinese population. Formerly concentrated in Manila, many Chinese moved to provinces that produced export crops the hemp-producing areas of southeastern Luzon and the eastern Visayas, the sugar areas of the western Visayas, and the tobaccco provinces of northeastern Luzon</p>

                <div class="title">
                    <h2>Monopolies</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Another main source of wealth during the post-galleon era was monopoly contracting After 1850, government monopoly contracts for the collection of different revenues were opened to foreigners for the first time. The Chinese instantly took advantage of this commercial opportunity and thus, for the rest of the 19th century, enjoyed a pre-eminent position in monopoly contracting in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>The opium monopoly was specifically a profitable one. During the 1840's, the Spanish government had legalized the use of opium (provided it was limited to Chinese) and a government monopoly of opium importation and sales was created The majority of contracts in the monopoly were held by the Chinese.</p>
