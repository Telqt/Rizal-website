                    <h2>Education in Manila and Europe and Early Travels</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Don Francisco sent his son Jose for further education to Manila in June 1872 Paciano found Jose a boarding house in Intramuros though lose later transferred to a house on Calle Carballo in the Santa Cruz area In the following year, Jose transferred residence to No. 6 Calle Magallanes. Two years later, he became an intern (boarding student) at Ateneo and stayed there until his graduation from the institution.</p>
                <div class="works">
                    <p>From 1877 to 1882. Rizal studied at the University of Santo Tomas, enrolling in the course Philosophy and Letters, but shifted to Medicine a year after. During his first year at UST., he simultaneously took at the Ateneo a vocational course leading to being an expert surveyor. He boarded in the house of a certain Concha Leyva in Intramuros, and later in Casa Tomasina, at Calle 6. Santo Tomas, Intramuros in Casa Tomasina, his landlord and uncle Antonio Rivera had a daughter. Leonor, who became Jose's sweetheart. (For Jose Rizal's love affair with Leonor Rivera [and another Leonor-Leonor Valenzuela], read Appendix P. "Jose Rizal's Filipino Girlfriends")</p>

                    <h2>Education at the Ateneo</h2>
                </div>
                <p>There is a claim that from the Biñan school, Rizal studied at Colegio de San Juan de Letran. The supposed story stated that after attending his classes for almost three months in Letran, Jose was asked by the Dominican friars to look for another school because of his radical and bold questions.</p>
                <p>However, standard biographies agree that Rizal just took the entrance examination in that institution, but Don Francisco sent him to enroll instead in Ateneo Municipal in June 1872. Run by the Jesuit congregation (Society of Jesus) Ateneo upheld religious instruction, advanced education, rigid discipline, physical culture, and cultivation of the arts. like music, drawing, and painting. (Ironically, this school, which is now the archrival of De La Salle in being exclusively luxurious. among others, was formerly the Escuela Pia (Charity School)-a school for poor boys in Manila established by the city government in 1817.)</p>

                <div class="title">
                    <h2>Education at the UST</h2>
                </div>
                <p>In 1877, Rizal enrolled in the University of Santo Tornas, taking the course on Philosophy and Letters. At the same time, however, he took at the Ateneo a land- veyor and assessor's degree (expert surveyor), a vocational course. He finished his surveyor's training in 1877, passed the licensing examination in May 1878 though the license was granted to him only in 1881 when he reached the age of majority.</p>
                <p>After a year at UST. Jose changed course and enrolled in Medicine to be able to cure the deteriorating eyesight of his mother. Being tired of the discrimination by the Dominican professors against Filipino students, he nonetheless stopped attending classes at UST in 1882. It is worthwhile to note that another reason for Rizal's not completing medicine at UST was that the method of instruction was obsolete and repressive. (Rizal's observation perhaps had served as a challenge for UST to improve its mode of instruction.)</p>
                <div class="title">
                    <h2>Education in Europe</h2>
                </div>
                <p>On May 3. 1882. Rizal left for Spain and enrolled in Medicine and Philosophy and Letters at the Universidad Central de Madrid on November 3 On some days of November 1884, Rizal was involved in the chootic student demonstrations by the Central University students in which many were wounded. hit by cane, arrested. and imprisoned. The protest rallies started after Dr. Miguel Morayta had been excommunicated by bishops for delivering a liberal speech proclaiming the freedom of science and the teacher, at the opening ceremony of the academic year (Incidentally, the street in Manila named after Morayta ["Nicanor Reyes Street today] has always been affected by if not itself the venue of, student demonstrations)</p>

                <div class="title">
                    <h2>Life in Europe</h2>
                </div>
                <p>As mentioned. Rizal stopped attending classes at UST in 1882, for he was sick and tired of the discriminatory and oppressive Dominican professors. On May 3 of that year, he thus left for Spain not only to complete his studies but also to widen his political knowledge through exposure to European governments. It is funny that his departure for Spain had gone down to history as a "secret departure", although at least ten people-including his three siblings and an uncle-collaborated in his going away, exclusive of the unnamed and unnumbered Jesuit priests and intimate friends who co-conspired in the plan.</p>
                <p>Jose Rizal's life abroad was marked by significant achievements and contributions to Philippine history and literature. He pursued higher education in Europe, studying medicine and other fields while becoming deeply involved in advocating for reforms in the Philippines. Rizal's literary works, particularly his novels "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo", exposed the abuses of Spanish colonizers and inspired nationalist sentiments among Filipinos. He actively engaged with the Filipino community in Europe, organizing gatherings and fostering unity among expatriates. Throughout his travels, Rizal experienced periods of exile, both in Europe and in the Philippines. His experiences abroad shaped his political activism, leading him to call for reforms and encourage Filipinos to strive for education and enlightenment. Rizal's ideas and writings became foundational to the Philippine revolution against Spanish colonial rule, and he is celebrated as a national hero for his contributions to Philippine independence and his promotion of Filipino identity and nationalism.</p>
