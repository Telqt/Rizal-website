                <p>Jose Rizal learned about it either from his uncle or from his "best friend. Some references state that Rizal as a child heard from his uncle, José Alberto, about this ancient history of the Philippines written by a Spaniard named Antonio de Morga. Some other sources claim that Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas (Events in the Philippine Islands) was suggested by Austrian scholar Ferdinand Blumentritt (1853- 1913) for Rizal's research on pre-Spanish Philippines.</p>

                    <h2>Dr. Morga and his 'Sucesos'</h2>
                </div>

                <div class="works">
                    <p>Antonio de Morga (1559-1636) was a Spanish historian and lawyer and a notable colonial official for 43 years in the Philippines, New Spain, and Peru. He stayed in the Philippines, then a colony of Spain, from 1594 to 1604. As Deputy Governor in the Philippines, he reestablished the audencia and took over the function of judge ("oidor"). <br>
                    When reassigned to Mexico, he published the book Sucesos de las islas Filipinas in 1609, considered one of the most significant works on the early history of the Spanish colonization of the Philippines. The history is said to cover the years from 1493 to 1603. Discussions deal with the political, social, and economic phases of life of both the natives and their colonizers. Morga's official position as a colonial officer allowed him access to many government documents. Probably the best account of Spanish colonialism in the Philippines written during that period.

                    <h2>Rizal's Annotation of the Book</h2>
                </div>

                <p>Patriotic as he was. Jose Rizal had an ardent longing to know the true condition of the Philippines when the Spanish conquerors came ashore to the islands. He had been working on the sensible presupposition that the native populations in the archipelago were economically self-sufficient and thriving and culturally lively and colorful. He did not believe the colonizers claim that they sociologically improved the islands, instead. Rizal supposed that the Spanish colonization somewhat resulted in the deterioration of the Philippine's rich culture and tradition.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>To back his theory up. Rizal had to look for a reliable account of the Philippines before and at the onset of Spanish colonization. Hence, his friend Dr. Ferdinand Blumentritt, a knowledgeable Filipinologist, recommended Dr. Antonio Morga Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas. Even then, this history of the Philippines had the impression among many scholars of having an honest description of the Philippin situation as regards the era covered. <br>
                    In 1888-1889, Rizal largely spent his many months of stay in London at the British Museum researching from its Filipiniana Collection, looking for Morga's book, and then copying and annotating this rare book available in the library. Having no high-tech copying technology at that time, he had to painstakingly hand-copy the whole 351 pages of Morga's work.
                    Leaving London for Paris in March 1889. Rizal frequented the Bibliotheque Nationale to continue working on his annotation of the Sucesos. It was thus in Paris that he finished and published his annotation of the Sucesos in 1890.

                    <h2>The Preface</h2>
                </div>
                <p>With "José Rizal, Europe, 1889" as a signature, Rizal had the following as his Preface to his work (as translated in English):</p>
                <i>
                <p>To the Filipinos: In Noli Me Tangere ("The Social Cancer") I started to sketch the present state of our native land. But the effect which my effort produced made me realize that, before attempting to unroll before your eyes the other pictures which were to follow, it was necessary first to post you on the past. So only can you fairly judge the present and estimate how much progress has been made during the three centuries (of Spanish rule).</p>
                <p>Like almost all of you. I was born and brought up in ignorance of our country's past and so, without knowledge or authority to speak of what I neither saw nor have studied, I deem it necessary to quote the testimony of an illustrious Spaniard who in the beginning of the new era controlled the destinies of the Philippines and had personal knowledge of our ancient nationality in its last days.</p>
                <p>It is then the shade of our ancestor's civilization which the author will call before you. If the work serves to awaken in you a consciousness of our past, and to blot from your memory or to rectify what has been falsified or is calumny, then I shall not have labored in vain. With this preparation, slight though it may be, we can all pass to the study of the future" ("Annotations to Dr. Antonio Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas," n.d.)</p></i>

                    <h2>Some Important Annotations</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="works">
                    <p>Austin Craig (1872-1949), an early biographer of Rizal. translated into English some of the more important of Rizal's annotations in the Sucesos. <br> <br>
                    The value of Rizal's annotation of Sucesos is immense as through the work, he provided especially the Filipino readers with rich annotative footnotes concerning Philippine culture and society. coupled with complete scholarly referenced resources and full citations. Most especially, through this work. Rizal had proved and showed that the Philippines was an advanced civilization prior to the Spanish conquest.

                    <h2>The Value of Rizal's Annotation</h2>
                </div>
                <p>The significance of Rizal's noble purpose in working on Morga's book is prophetically encapsulated in some of his statements in his Preface: "If the book (Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas) succeeds to awaken your consciousness of our past. already effaced from your memory, and to rectify what has been falsified and slandered, then I have not worked in vain, and with this as a basis, however small it may be, we shall be able to study the future."</p>
